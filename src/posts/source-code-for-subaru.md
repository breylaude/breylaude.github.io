I found it a year ago, made minor modifications and compiled successfully. However, to get it deployed is another large task which I didnâ€™t follow through with, there are probably people who have done so already, I'm not sure.

Many modules were written since other car manufacturers share the same codebase. You can also find Toyota version as well.

Send me an email if you do.
