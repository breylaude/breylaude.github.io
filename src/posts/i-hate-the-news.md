Some people start their day with the radio. Others wind down with the evening news. Some scroll through social media, while others stay current by following YouTube channels like CNN. There are even those who get breaking news alerts straight to their phones. One thing they all seem to agree on: keeping up with the news is every citizen’s duty. Everyone, that is—except me.

Some people share my view—at least to a point. They criticize cable news for its obsession with sensational crimes, its fixation on horse-race political coverage, and the flood of PR-driven fluff. But they see these as flaws in an otherwise salvageable system. Me? I take it a step further: I don’t think any of it is worth saving.

If you look at the front page of today’s New York Times, there's data that indicates an increase in abortions in 2024,there's international relations; some diplomatic strategies shift. Stock prices going down. China's economic growth.Hollywood actors union reaching new contract agreement.

These stories have no real connection to my life. Reading them might be enjoyable, but it's an enjoyable waste of time. They won't influence my actions in any way.

Most people will typically agree with this point but argue that there's some virtue in knowing it regardless, claiming it makes me a better citizen. They highlight that newspapers are essential to our democracy, as by exposing wrongdoing, they compel wrongdoers to cease their actions.

This seems to be true, but what's curious is that I’m never personally involved. The government commits a crime, the News reports it on the front page, people get worked up about it, the government apologizes, and then continues committing the crime more discreetly. It’s a valuable system — I definitely support the government being more discreet about its wrongdoings (well, for the sake of argument) — but notice how it never affects me? It seems like the whole process would function just as well even if no one read the news or watched the talk shows. It's a self-contained system.

Of course, there’s voting, but to become an informed voter, all one needs to do is read a brief guide about the candidates and issues before the election. There's no need to endure the daily back-and-forth of accusations and counterclaims, of malicious lies and their rebuttals. In fact, reading a voter’s guide is far better: there’s no recency bias (where you only remember the scandals reported in the past few months), you get to hear both sides of the story after the investigations have cooled down, and you can actually think about the issues without getting caught up in the politics.

Some people say that, while most news isn’t useful, every now and then you might stumble upon a story that genuinely shifts your focus or changes what you're working on. But how plausible is that, really? Most significant life changes don’t come from a news article — they come from reading in-depth essays or thoughtful books, which are much more convincing and detailed.

Which brings me to my second example of people agreeing with me in a limited sense. TV critics often point out how ridiculous some news channel reporting can be. Rather than saying things like, *“We have unconfirmed reports that—Wait! This just in! Those unconfirmed reports have been denied. Hold on! Now there’s a report denying the confirmation of the denial of the unconfirmed report,”* and giving viewers whiplash, they suggest a more sensible approach: wait until the story is confirmed, then report it — and fill the time with commentary in the meantime.

But if that logic holds true over the span of minutes, why stop there? If hourly updates are unnecessary, why not just read it daily? And if the daily is too much, why not opt for a weekly summary? Or better yet, a monthly summary? And if that’s still too frequent, why not an annual book?

With the time people waste watching/reading a news every day, they could have read an entire book on most of the topics covered, gaining far more detail and insight than the brief snippets the clips/reels/page offers. But of course, people wouldn’t read a book on most of those subjects, because most of them are simply irrelevant.

Finally, I’d argue that following the news isn’t just a waste of time; it’s actively unhealthy. Edward Tufte points out that when he used to read the New York Times in the morning, it overloaded his mind with so many different topics that he couldn’t focus on any meaningful intellectual work for the rest of the day.

The news’s obsession with having a little bit of information on a wide variety of subjects means that it actually gets most of those subjects wrong. (One need only read the blatant errors reported in the corrections page to get some sense of the more thorough-going errors that must lie beneath them. And, indeed, anyone who has ever been in the news will tell you that the news always gets the story wrong.) Its obsession with the criminal and the deviant makes us less trusting people. Its obsession with the hurry of the day-to-day makes us less reflective thinkers. Its obsession with surfaces makes us shallow.

This is not simply an essay meant to provoke; I genuinely believe what I write. I have not followed the news at least since I was 19 (with occasional lapses on particular topics). My life does not seem to be impoverished for it; indeed, I think it has been greatly enhanced. But I haven’t found many other people who are willing to take the plunge.
