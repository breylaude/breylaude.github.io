A friend told me about a life philosophy she finds interesting. She shared the classic story of the fox and the sour grapes.

In the story, a fox sees a bunch of juicy grapes hanging from a vine. He tries reaching them, first by putting his paws on the fence, then by climbing it, but ends up cutting his paw. 
Frustrated, he decides the grapes must be sour anyway and walks away. 

This is the traditional *"sour grapes"* story, and usually people who have this, you know, those angry sorts of people, basically dismiss things they can't have in a bitter way.

But she gave the story a positive spin. She said that when the fox cut his paw, it could have been a divine sign from God that the grapes were poisonous, and that was why he couldn’t reach them. It’s like taking a bad situation and finding a reason to see it as a good thing.

As I thought about it, I realized that as you go through life, there are things you don't get, and you just convince yourself you didn’t want them in the first place. You put a positive spin on it. It's like creating your own meaning. This is where I think existentialism comes in — the idea that you’re in control of finding meaning in life.

I’m not sure I have it all figured out, but my personal opinion is that there’s no such thing as *"wasting time."* Like its stupid, wasting time is great, this is the point of time, to waste. 

But I’ll add one caveat to that: Don’t fall in funnels, if you are in other people’s funnels, don’t be in skinner boxes, and don’t be influenced by advertising.
